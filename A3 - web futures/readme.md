Reflective Writing – Assessment 3 Web Futures 

Topic Choice and Decision Making

The topic of the website is furniture, particularly chairs. The site acts like a marketing / shop site displaying many influential designs. The previous year I had designed a site around clay pots for Introduction to Interaction Design. This site acts as an improved version with improved layout whilst being fully responsive. Incorporation of AI content aided me with the written segments of the site. Use of simple phrases such “Write an about section for a chair selling website.” Additionally, before coding the site, I experimented with basic phrases such as “write me code for a website selling chairs” which provided me a basic framework for website structure. A bit of this code has been used on home page with two chairs side-by side.

Front-end Web Design Concepts

The site has been optimized for desktop, laptop and mobile screen devices. Because these are the primary ways these types of websites are accessed through, I have limited responsiveness to match these screen sizes. Responsive grids and containers, scaling images and text, responsive nav-bars are incorporated to account for these smaller screen sizes. Format of content is flexible and adaptable whilst being completely functional allowing convenience and ease of use.

Challenges and Solutions During Development

Most challenges I faced were related to adding the responsive elements. For example, the chairs at the top of the page. Because I had leveraged the mix of AI and my own code, I had not realized the container that the items were placed in. Therefore, I added a media query which changed the format to a grid format once reaching a certain size. However, grids would often format in the wrong order placing where headers would be stacked atop each other or images stacked atop of each other. Using the grid template columns and assigning IDs to each column and row fixed the issue, now stacked in the correct order. Inclusion of the responsive navigation was difficult, whilst still not perfect, particularly the transitioning and positioning of the hamburger menu. Unsure on how to keep it to the side. The drop-down menu doesn’t work exactly as intended as the minus state doesn’t function, whilst boxes will close after opening another, creating a bounce affect with the footer. 

Lessons learned and Improvements for Future Projects

Addition of more clickable and interactive elements could aid the site. The current website is serves as a foundation. Inclusion of linked buttons, clickable images in the selection tab. Additionally implementation of colours between sections could add visual depth. Whilst the current site is fully functional, errors in navigation display and drop-down menus could be resolved within a future project. Overall, this assignment helped me understand responsive grid-layouts and responsive web-design. There are many improvements from the first assignment, which I am quite satisfied with – the design, formatting and responsiveness.
